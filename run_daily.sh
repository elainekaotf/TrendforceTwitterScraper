# The Mac sleeps between scheduled runs (nothing here ever disabled system

# 04:30 run never appeared in this log at all. `pmset repeat` only holds
# ONE daily wake time, not all six of this job's slots, so instead each run
# schedules a ONE-TIME wake for whichever of the six slots comes next -
# scheduled right at the START of the run (before any scraping) so it
# still happens even if this run itself fails or crashes partway through.
# Requires passwordless sudo for `pmset schedule` (see sudoers setup note
# in the project's own docs/history) - without that, this just logs a
# warning and the run continues normally; it only affects whether the
# NEXT slot gets a wake scheduled, not this run.

# TrendForceDash runs on its own independent schedule (0/4/6/8/12/16/18/20),

# unsynced for hours until TrendForceDash's own next scheduled run. Sync and
# push it immediately after every run here instead of waiting.
#
# Backgrounded (not awaited): trendforce-daily is a single launchd Label with
# a fixed StartCalendarInterval (0:30/4:30/8:30/...) - launchd does NOT queue
# a missed firing while the previous instance of the same Label is still
# running, it just skips it. This chained sync occasionally took several
# hours (observed 2026-07-14: a run starting 00:44 didn't finish until
# ~09:32), which silently ate the 4:30 AND 8:30 firings entirely - nothing
# re-scraped tphuang (or anyone else) for ~9 hours, purely because this
# script itself hadn't returned yet. Running it detached lets run_daily.sh
# (and therefore the next scheduled scrape) finish on time regardless of how
# long the sync takes. run_pipeline.sh has its own independent
# FAILURES/alert.sh handling and logs to TrendForceDash/pipeline.log, so
# nothing here needs to wait for or re-check its result.
#
# nohup + disown alone are NOT enough under launchd (found the hard way,
# same day: the 16:30 run's backgrounded sync never even logged its first
# line). nohup only blocks SIGHUP; launchd's default behavior on a user
# LaunchAgent is to kill the ENTIRE process group the moment the tracked
# process (this script) exits, which kills the backgrounded child too since
# disown doesn't move it to a different process group. The actual fix is
# the plist's own <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key><true/> (added to
# com.elainekao.trendforce-daily.plist), which tells launchd to leave
# stragglers alone - nothing to change here, just don't remove the
# backgrounding above assuming it's self-sufficient without that plist key.
