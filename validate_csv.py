"""
Sanity-checks account CSVs before publish.sh commits/publishes anything.
Catches the failure mode from 2026-07-03: a dedup script crashed mid-write
and truncated TrendForce.csv from ~570 rows to 12, which then got committed
and published silently because nothing checked row counts or file shape.

Exit code 0 = all clear. Exit code 1 = one or more accounts failed a check;
publish.sh aborts before touching git so a corrupt scrape never goes live.
